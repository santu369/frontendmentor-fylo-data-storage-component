## My process

Worked on Mobile first approach, then added media queries, adjusting the layout.
First time tried to build a component using bootstrap css, handled most of the cases using bbootstrap classes instead of using custom css.
Added small animations for the components to run on page load for only those who didn't set preference to reduce animations.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- SASS
- CSS Animations
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

Using Bootstrap CSS for quickly coming up with layouts.

### Continued development

Will work more with bootstrap for other challenges. Once comfortable, will implement react in further projects.
